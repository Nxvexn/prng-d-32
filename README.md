## Features

- **Fast Generation**: PRNG-D-32 is optimized for speed, making it ideal for applications requiring rapid random number generation.
- **Statistical Strength**: The algorithm ensures a high level of randomness, suitable for cryptographic applications and simulations.
- **32-bit Output**: It generates 32-bit integers, a common requirement in many programming tasks.
- **Long Period**: With a minimum period of \(2^{128}\), it provides a vast sequence of random numbers before repeating.

## Installation

To get started with PRNG-D-32, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nxvexn/prng-d-32.git
cd prng-d-32
```

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
- CMake for building the project

### Build the Project

After cloning the repository, build the project using CMake:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage

To use the PRNG-D-32, include the header file in your project:

```cpp
#include "prng_d_32.h"
```

### Example Code

Here is a simple example of how to use the PRNG-D-32:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "prng_d_32.h"

int main() {
    PRNGD32 prng; // Create an instance of the PRNG
    prng.seed(12345); // Seed the generator

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        std::cout << prng.generate() << std::endl; // Generate random numbers
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Seeding

To ensure different sequences of random numbers, always seed the generator before use. You can use any integer value as a seed.

## Performance

PRNG-D-32 is designed for high performance. Here are some benchmarks:

- **Random Number Generation Speed**: The generator can produce thousands of random numbers per second, depending on the hardware.
- **Statistical Tests**: The generated numbers pass various statistical tests, including the Diehard tests and the NIST test suite.
